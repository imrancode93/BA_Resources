Common reference_options include:

CASCADE: Apply the same operation to the child row(s).
ON DELETE CASCADE: If a parent row is deleted, any matching child rows are also deleted.
ON UPDATE CASCADE: If the parent’s key value changes, the child’s foreign key value is updated to match.

SET NULL: Set the foreign key column(s) in the child table to NULL.
ON DELETE SET NULL: If the parent row is deleted, the child row’s foreign key is set to NULL.
ON UPDATE SET NULL: If the parent’s key value changes, the child’s foreign key column is set to NULL.

RESTRICT (or NO ACTION): Prevent the operation if there are any matching child rows.
ON DELETE RESTRICT: If a parent row has child rows, deleting that parent will fail.
ON UPDATE RESTRICT: If a parent row has child rows, updating the parent’s key will fail.

So, to break it down simply:

ON DELETE ... – What should happen in the child table when the parent row is deleted?
ON UPDATE ... – What should happen in the child table when the parent row is updated (specifically, if the referenced key column changes)?
